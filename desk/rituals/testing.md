# Testing ritual

## Purpose

_Explain why this ritual exists._

Prove the intended contract of a graph_ui task with the smallest relevant validation first, then broaden coverage when the change touches shared behavior.

## Trigger

_State when this ritual should start._

When the execution ritual for a task completes and the change needs validation.

## Preconditions

_List the conditions that must hold before running the ritual._

- The task implementation is complete.
- The affected test surface is known.

## Validation

_List the checks that prove the ritual was performed correctly._

- `pytest` passes for backend changes.
- `npm test` passes for `apps/review-workbench` changes.

## Failure Modes

_List common mistakes this ritual prevents._

- Broadening coverage before the narrow contract is proven.
- Skipping the frontend suite when the UI changed.

## Completion

_Describe what completion looks like._

The task's contract is proven green and the change is ready for closeout.
