## Purpose

_Explain why this ritual exists._

Close a graph_ui task only after validation passes, the board reflects reality, and the final change is captured as its own atomic commit.

## Trigger

## Preconditions

_List the conditions that must hold before running the ritual._

- The board and task status match the implemented reality.

## Validation

- The closing change is a single atomic commit.

## Failure Modes

- Leaving the board out of sync with the code.

## Completion
